Hi
Starting on the 14th of May 2023

19th May 2023
Planning to build a stock price analyzer using the simple machine learning algorithm
The second step would be to use the lstm model 
The third model would be based on the transformer model

Today itself I am going to deploy a simple machine-learning model using a basic machine-learning algorithm
and tomorrow I will look for the lstm model and get my hand on the transformer encoding to be used for the transformer model.
